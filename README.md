# Bank Customer Churn prediction Analysis
# by Vamsi Krishna Midathala

# Project Goal: 
A Fictitious Bank, serving around 10,000 customers across 3 European countries, faces a crucial challenge with the customer leaving their business which has gradually increased over time. The bank objects to addressing this issue proactively by developing and deploying a predictive model that can forecast and identify at-risk customers before they decide to leave. This leads to the enhancement of techniques and strategies for customer retention with low-cost efficiency.

The Primary Objective of this project is to deploy a robust and generalized churn prediction model that helps banks to forecast customer churn from both existing and new customer data. This will allow the bank to take pointed actions to reduce churn ratios. In addition, the project also aims to understand and disclose the underlying patterns and statistics about factors influencing customer churn. Specifically, will explore relationships between churn and demographic factors for instance age, Income, and region. Behavioral factors like the count of products registered by customers, and the number of years of being a customer in the bank. To achieve these objectives, I will employ a combination of three machine learning algorithms to predict the target variable. Those are a linear model, a Non-linear model, and an Ensemble method to optimize the prediction rate.
